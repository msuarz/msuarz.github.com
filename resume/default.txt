Experience

UKG - Principal Software Engineer (2020 – Present)
Ultimate Software merged with Kronos into a gigantic juggernaut to conquer the HRMS space. I took the helm of the Application team within the Recruiting module.

- Created the Lab, a virtual collaboration space where the team tackles complex problems using mob programming.
- Delivered Indeed's integration within a strict 3-month deadline by utilizing Kanban techniques, limiting work in progress, swarming on aging tasks, and employing Monte Carlo simulations for estimation.
- Simplified microservices integration by publishing fat events on Kafka Streams, reducing MongoDB usage by 10%.
- Integrated Copilot into multiple development workflows, enhancing TCR, TDD, BDD, and unit testing practices.
- Containerized the application by migrating deployments from on-premise VMs in OpenStack to containers in GCP, reducing deployment time from 40 minutes to mere seconds.
- Modernized the CI/CD pipeline by transitioning from TeamCity to GitHub Actions, decreasing overall run time from over 5 hours to under 1 hour.

Ultimate Software - Tech Lead (2014 – 2020)
Embraced the DevOps movement by founding rCloud, a homebrewed PaaS platform, lifting a monolith from the '90s to the cloud. (CI/CD)

- Orchestrated UKGPro deployments on dynamic topologies in ESX, OpenStack, and GCP, reducing regression testing time from two months to one week.
- Designed HALO, an Angular reactive SPA, increasing the adoption of the platform by 20%.
- Organically grew the solution from a set of Rake tasks into a monolithic application, then modularized it into gems and a family of Ruby on Rails microservices around emerging Bounded Contexts.
- Relentlessly applied Domain-Driven Design (DDD), distilling business rules until developing Corals, a domain-specific language (DSL) that enabled expressing the Core Domain in a declarative way.

Ultimate Software - Senior Software Engineer (2008 – 2014)
Joined the Ulti family in the midst of the Agile revolution. Drove DevOps and Kanban adoption, enhanced system efficiency, and pioneered Behavior Driven Development practices, fostering continuous growth and innovation.

- Pioneered DevOps adoption in collaboration with ThoughtWorks to develop Recruiting, the first module independent of the monolith, increasing the UltiPro suite's average price per employee by $5.
- Developed Droolz, a RESTful API for JBoss Drools, enabling the declaration and execution of business rules in an external DSL, which paved the way for extracting the Payroll process from the monolithic application.
- Refactored the primary bottleneck in the Map/Reduce algorithm that hydrated domain entities by effective date, enabling the use of MongoDB as an Event Store.
- Attended the first Kanban conference, adopted it within a team of 5, and scaled it to a team of 17, reshaping the company's approach to software development.
- Contributed to Gojko Adzic's book "Specification by Example", increasing Ultimate Software's exposure and helping define the practice of Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

Alienware - Software Engineer (2004 – 2008)
Got abducted into the realm of machine assembly. Amped up processes, quality, and performance of software solutions geared toward elite hardware consumers.

- Optimized the Alienfactory provisioning process, reducing assembly time per machine by 25%.
- Introduced Agile by blending XP and Scrum, achieving immediate improvements in communication through daily standups and pair programming.
- Mastered Test-Driven Development (TDD) by mentoring peers in AlienLabs, fostering camaraderie and team spirit, and reducing defect count on a greenfield project by 80% compared to manually tested projects.
- Led the team to reengineer a legacy C++ account manager system into C# and simultaneously deliver WinForms and ASP.NET clients within four months.
