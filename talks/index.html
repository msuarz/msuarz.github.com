            Presented with my wife. Our 45 minutes of fame.<br/>
            This was my last talk about Raconteur. It's quite polished.<br/>
            However I did an awful job recording it. I was too far from the mic during the first 9 mins<br/>
            These are my favorite slides among all.

            My last lunch and learn. I did a few in a row and stopped.<br/>
            In 2013 lunch & Learn sessions started to get company support.<br/>
            Presenters get $100 bonus now and the company provides pizza.<br/>
            I'm like $500 short in my bank account but I'll be back. Muuuuuuuuahhahahaha ....

            This one was for my team only. I treat them to pizza meself.<br/>
            It kicked up a lot of improvements in our testing approach.<br/>
            Sadly it didn't spread over the company.<br/>
            In 2012 the whole company started using an approach similar to the one developed by my team.<br/>
            But we are still testing thru the UI.
