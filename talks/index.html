            My last lunch and learn. After 5 in a row nobody stepped up.<br/>
            I am glad to report that it's 2013 and the Lunch and Learn thing is official at work.<br/>

            This one was for my team only. I treat them to pizza meself.<br/>
            it kicked up a lot of improvements in our testing approach.<br/>
            Althou for some reason managements did not get into it.<br/>
            In 2012 the whole company started using an approach similar to the one developed by my team
